## ML for Modern Portfolio Theory
### Contents:
- combine six stocks and create a combined portfolio
- generate random portfolios with random weights on the three stocks to compute efficient frontiers
- calculate an optimal portfolio by selecting the portfolio with best sharpe ratio
- predict the portfolio weights using a RandomForest Regressor with exponentially weighted moving averages of prices
- compare return of predictions on portfolio with individual stock
### Tools:
- MPT, Sharpe Ratios
